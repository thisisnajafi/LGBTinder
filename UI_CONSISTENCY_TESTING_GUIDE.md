# UI Consistency Testing Guide

Date: October 25, 2025
Purpose: Verify all UI consistency fixes work correctly in both light and dark modes

## Pre-Testing Checklist

- [ ] Pull latest changes from main branch (commit: 4499782)
- [ ] Run flutter clean
- [ ] Run flutter pub get
- [ ] Verify no linter errors: flutter analyze
- [ ] Verify app builds: flutter build apk --debug

## Testing Scope

All UI consistency fixes made during this session:
1. Hardcoded colors (119 instances fixed)
2. Border radius standardization (23 instances fixed)
3. Spacing standardization (~12 instances fixed)
4. Typography migration (102 instances fixed)

## Test Plan

### Phase 1: Build Verification

#### Step 1.1: Clean Build
- Run: flutter clean
- Run: flutter pub get
- Run: flutter build apk --debug
- Expected: Build succeeds with no errors
- Status: ___

#### Step 1.2: Linter Check
- Run: flutter analyze
- Expected: No new errors introduced
- Status: ___

### Phase 2: Visual Regression Testing

#### 2.1: Light Mode - Components

Test Files:
- components/profile/safety_verification_section.dart
- components/profile/profile_header.dart

For each component:
- [ ] Colors look correct (no hardcoded values visible)
- [ ] Border radius consistent (12px standard)
- [ ] Spacing consistent (8px grid)
- [ ] Text sizes appropriate
- [ ] No visual glitches

#### 2.2: Dark Mode - Components

Same components as 2.1, but in dark mode:

- [ ] Text readable (proper contrast)
- [ ] Background colors appropriate
- [ ] Icons visible
- [ ] No hardcoded light-only colors

#### 2.3: Light Mode - Pages

- pages/profile_wizard_page.dart
- pages/home_page.dart

For each page:
- [ ] Overall layout correct
- [ ] Colors consistent with theme
- [ ] Border radius standardized
- [ ] Spacing feels natural
- [ ] Typography hierarchy clear

#### 2.4: Dark Mode - Pages

Same pages as 2.3, but in dark mode:
- [ ] Page backgrounds appropriate
- [ ] Card colors correct
- [ ] Text contrast sufficient
- [ ] Interactive elements visible
- [ ] No light mode bleed-through

#### 2.5: Light Mode - Screens

Test Files:
- screens/profile_edit_screen.dart
- screens/auth/login_screen.dart (if accessible)

For each screen:
- [ ] Form elements styled correctly
- [ ] Buttons have correct colors
- [ ] Input fields readable
- [ ] Spacing consistent
- [ ] Typography clear

#### 2.6: Dark Mode - Screens

Same screens as 2.5, but in dark mode:
- [ ] Form inputs visible
- [ ] Button contrast good
- [ ] Text readable
- [ ] Borders visible where needed
- [ ] No hardcoded colors

### Phase 3: Functional Testing

#### 3.1: Theme Switching
- [ ] App starts in correct theme (light/dark based on system)
- [ ] Theme toggle works (if implemented)
- [ ] All screens update when theme changes
- [ ] No flicker or delay
- [ ] Persistent across app restarts

#### 3.2: Component Interactions
- [ ] Super Like sheet opens correctly
- [ ] Profile cards display properly
- [ ] Statistics update correctly
- [ ] Photo gallery functions
- [ ] All interactive elements respond

#### 3.3: Navigation
- [ ] Navigate between all modified screens
- [ ] Back button works correctly
- [ ] No visual artifacts during transitions
- [ ] Theme consistent across navigation
- [ ] No crashes or errors

### Phase 4: Edge Cases

#### 4.1: Different Screen Sizes
Test on:
- [ ] Small phone (e.g., iPhone SE)
- [ ] Medium phone (e.g., iPhone 13)
- [ ] Large phone (e.g., Pixel 7 Pro)
- [ ] Tablet (if supported)

For each:
- [ ] Spacing scales appropriately
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Buttons remain tappable
- [ ] Layout doesn't break

#### 4.2: Accessibility
- [ ] Text scaling works (increase system font size)
- [ ] Colors have sufficient contrast
- [ ] Interactive elements have proper sizes (48x48 minimum)
- [ ] Screen reader compatible (if tested)

#### 4.3: Performance
- [ ] No noticeable lag from theme application
- [ ] Smooth scrolling on fixed pages
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] App remains responsive
